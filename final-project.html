		<h2>Flower</h2>
			<p class="w3-justify">This art work is called Vanitas Still Life with a Tulip, Skull and Hour Glass, by Philippe de Champaigne. The rationale of the memento mori tradition is that we'll commit fewer sins, waste less time, if we remember our end. I used photoshop timeline to create the three objects moving and creating canvas for the pieace to add text to it. Then, I picked the arond 5-8 images from the timeline to creat gif. Lastly, by using what I learn from Art 74 I used Audacity to creating the Echo effect. I called this the Flower beacuse the color of this gif is as colorful as the flower however don't forget about the nourishments over the time from the human body.</p>

		<h2>Skull</h2>
			<p class="w3-justify"> Skull uses the same technique and the audacity effect is Distortion plus Graphic EQ. If you take a closer look at the image, there are a sun, skull, and moon. The viewpoint is at the center of the sun and moon, the brightest and farthest is the sun and under the skull is the moon and we can see clearly those surfaces. Skull is the bridge of the sun and moon, it can also represents the stars like human, when we die we are became the star.</p>
		<iframe src="skull/index.html"	height ="810" width="1320" scrolling="no" title="skull"></iframe>
		<h2>Moon</h2>
			<p class="w3-justify">To create those balances of white, grey, and black. I played with Fade in, Fade out, and Invert in Audacity. Convert it to Gif. I like how this gif have the blue effect in the middle, just like a island flowing on the ocean. While the black gif, is fading into the ocean to the unknow darkness. </p>
		<iframe src="moon/index.html"	height ="810" width="1320" scrolling="no" title="moon"></iframe>
		<h2>Stoicism</h2>
			<p class="w3-justify"> Stocism is the a person who can endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining. The scupture is Zeno of Citium shining and the stoic symbol on top.The atom represent LOGOS and PHYSICS. The shield represents COURAGE and the ability to take life as it comes. The scale represents ETHICS JUSTICE. The venn diagram represents LOGIC and the three circles of ethics, logic, and physics to combine to form the sage. The letters Psi represents PSYCHOLOGY and its application to Stoicism. The only thing we can control is our own outlook. This is an combination of photoshop glitch and audacity glitch, I uses photoshop to make the RGB colors and the effect of Phaser to make the sliding effect.</p>
